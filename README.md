ML Final Project BIOF 509

Access to Mental Health Care During the COVID-19 Pandemic

Overview:
My project attempted to evaluate access to mental healthcare during the covid-19 pandemic. 
The dataset used was truncated from the overall dataset to represent only one time point 
mlfinalpt2.py was only used to rearrange data for generation of plots in excel.
mlfinalpt3.py was used to implement the SVM.

Running: 
filename/location of the dataset should be edited in line 125 of the mlfinalpt3.py to accurately reflect the current filename/location.
Upon running the program, a dialog box will ask for choice of group to be analyzed. Groups within the dataset of interest to this project include: By Age, By Education, and By Race/Hispanic ethnicity. Dialog Box will look for exact matches in group name to continue running.
No further input is required. 
The program prints the accuracy score as well as the confusion matrix for reference. The feature scores are plotted on a bar graph.
